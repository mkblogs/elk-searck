In this example , log file generated by server code and moved to volume as below

```docker

 volumes: 
      - applogs:/tmp/target/logs      

```

We can pass these log files to logstash container as like below

```docker

volumes:
      - applogs:/home/logs  

```

In logstash.conf  we can get logs from these location and pass to elasticsearch

```
input {
   file {
    type => "java"
    path => "/home/logs/*.log"
    start_position => "beginning"
  }
}
 
output {
    elasticsearch {
        hosts => [ "elasticsearch:9200" ]
        index => "logfiles-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    }
     stdout {
        codec => rubydebug
     }
}

```
